## After First Reply
When someone says "yes" to a demo:
1. Schedule a 30-min call (WhatsApp or Google Meet)
2. Ask: What are your top 5 most common customer questions?
3. Ask: How many WhatsApp messages/day?
4. Build a quick mock in 48h showing their FAQ handled by the agent
5. Close on a plan (recommend Profissional for most)
