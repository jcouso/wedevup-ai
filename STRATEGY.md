# STRATEGY

## Prime Directive
Generate legal revenue while preserving capital, reputation, and long-term optionality.

## Preference Hierarchy
1. Compounding assets (SaaS, APIs, AI tools)
2. Repeatable service engines
3. One-off income

## Current Thesis (set 2026-02-12)
**AI Automation Micro-Agency for Brazilian SMBs**, leveraging:
- Juan's 6+ year dev agency (WeDevUp) brand and ~10 existing clients
- Deep AI/automation skills (builds AI systems daily)
- WhatsApp as #1 business platform in Brazil
- Brazil trailing US/EU in AI adoption = greenfield opportunity

The wedge: **WhatsApp AI Agents for businesses** (customer support, lead qualification, appointment booking).
Every Brazilian SMB uses WhatsApp. Most handle it manually. AI agents = immediate ROI.

## Current Focus (Next 30 Days)
1. Package a productized WhatsApp AI Agent service
2. Validate demand via outreach to WeDevUp's existing network + cold prospects
3. Close first paying client within 14 days
4. Use first delivery as case study to scale

## Revenue Model
- Setup fee: R$2.000-R$5.000 (depending on complexity)
- Monthly maintenance/hosting: R$500-R$1.500/mo
- Target: 3 clients in 30 days = R$6K-15K setup + R$1.5K-4.5K MRR

## Distribution Channels (ranked by speed)
1. **Warm outreach** — existing WeDevUp clients (upsell) — TEMPLATES READY
2. **LinkedIn outbound** — targeted DMs to business owners in SP — TEMPLATES READY
3. **WhatsApp business groups** — communities of entrepreneurs
4. **Landing page** — BUILT, pending deploy (free: Vercel/Netlify/GH Pages)

## Assets Ready
- Offer doc: `offers/whatsapp-ai-agent.md`
- Landing page: **LIVE** → https://jcouso.github.io/wedevup-ai/
- Outreach templates: `outreach/templates.md` (with landing URL)
- Prospect targets (warm — Juan fills): `outreach/prospect-targets.md`
- Cold prospects (7 real businesses, pre-researched): `outreach/cold-prospects-sp.md`
- Execution playbook: `outreach/PLAYBOOK.md`

## Risk Guardrails
- No spam/scams
- No reputation-damaging tactics
- Low upfront capital by default
- Kill or pivot experiments that miss thresholds
- No spending without Juan's approval
